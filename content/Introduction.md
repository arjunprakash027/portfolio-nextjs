I am a software engineer working in **data science and data engineering**, passionate about **math, machine learning, computational science, and anything software-related**. Lately, Iâ€™ve been delving into **hardware** as well, exploring the intersection of software and physical systems.  

I spend most of my time **exploring open-source projects**, dissecting their code, and working on side missions (projects) that align with my curiosity at that particular moment. I belive there are always new challanges, opportunities and more mental frameworks and mindset to get us there. I love scaling softwares using low level optimizations and microservices architecture, distributed computing, low latency coding and math (and everything that goes well with math such as AI)

Outside of tech, I love reading books, mostly on **professional efficiency and philosophy**, seeking perspectives that refine both thought and execution.  

I currently work at **Jman Group** as a **Software Engineer**, where I build **data science models and data engineering pipelines**, applying full-scale **software engineering principles** to ensure performance, scalability, and maintainability.  

The side missions are all present on my [GitHub](https://github.com/arjunprakash027)
, I learn something and try to condense it into large blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/@arjunprakash027) and I regularly write mini blogs about a new technology, a new paper or whatever interests me at that moment in [Nuggets](/nuggets)  
My most upto date social is [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjunprakash027/), you can message me there or hit me up on arjunprakash027@gmail.com
