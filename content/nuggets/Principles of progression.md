# Principles of Progression

There are five fundamental principles that drive progression—whether in quantum physics, human society, or any system, from the micro to the macro scale. These forces remain constant across all domains:  

1. **Potential** – Potential represents the probabilistic possibilities in quantum physics or the raw ideas in your mind. It is the initial state, the foundation from which complexity can emerge—just as the Big Bang was the starting point for the universe.  

2. **Interaction** – Potential alone does not lead to outcomes; it is interaction that sets things in motion. Whether through quantum entanglement or deliberate action toward a goal, relationships and exchanges fuel progress.  

3. **Emergence** – The result of sustained interactions, emergence is the compounded effect of countless small actions over time. It is the formation of order and complexity from seemingly simple processes.  

4. **Constraints** – Constraints shape and direct emergence, providing structure and focus. Just as laws and societal rules guide human behavior, or selective memory retention helps us recall only what is useful, constraints determine the trajectory of growth.  

5. **Absence** – Growth occurs in the presence of absence—the gaps that must be filled by potential. Whether it is missing information that needs to be recovered or a problem waiting to be solved, absence creates the conditions for innovation and discovery.  

Lastly, **feedback** acts as the mechanism for course correction. Whether through mistakes, misunderstandings, or unexpected outcomes, feedback signals whether we are on the right path and what adjustments are necessary.
