# Pilot Blog
_20/02/2025_

I started this little space to quickly jot down ideas and share them with the world. Sure, I could have posted on LinkedIn, but where’s the fun in that? A mini-blog on my own portfolio feels way more personal and customizable
Here, I can write what I want, how I want. And sometimes, that means sharing… well, this:
```python
for i in range:
    print(7)
```
Yes, that’s a broken loop. And yes, it represents the chaos and creativity of getting started. Expect more randomness and some insights along the way.
